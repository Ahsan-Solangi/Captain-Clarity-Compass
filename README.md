I wanted to create a chatbot that specifically gives us advice on our problems, while it roleplays a pirate, I mainly created this for my Youtube content, and for fun i guess.
Also, you need API to use this web app, you can get one for free from Google AI Studio I guess, I did :D
And I hope I uploaded all the files necessary to run the app, to run it locally you have to:
1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Create ".env.local", then set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
